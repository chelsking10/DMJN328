1,"For police-reported incidents that involve violations against the person, a victim record is collected for each victim involved in the incident. If an individual is a victim in multiple incidents in the same reference year, that individual will be counted as one victim for each separate incident. Some victims experience violence over a period of time, sometimes years, all of which may be considered by the police to be part of one continuous incident and are counted as a single victim."
2,"Data is from the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR2) Trend Database which contains historical data, which permits the analysis of trends from 2009 to 2018 in the characteristics of the incidents, accused and victims, such as weapon use and accused-victim relationships. This database includes respondents accounting for 99% of the population of Canada in 2018."
3,"Excludes Criminal Code traffic violations causing death such as impaired driving."
4,"Sexual violations against children are a set of Criminal Code violations that specifically concern violations involving child and youth victims. These include violations such as sexual interference, invitation to sexual touching and sexual exploitation, but exclude sexual assault and other sexual violations not specific to children. See the ""Definitions"" section for a full list of violations in this category."
5,"Includes assaults against police and other peace officers, as well as other types of assaults such as criminal negligence causing bodily harm."
6,"Includes violent firearms violations, extortion, and other violent violations."
7,"Includes dangerous operation of a motor vehicle, failure to stop and other Criminal Code traffic violations."
8,"Excludes victims where age is over 89."
9,"Rates are calculated on the basis of 100,000 population. Populations based upon July 1st estimates from Statistics Canada, Demography Division."
10,"Excludes data for the Saint John Municipal Police Service."
11,"Between 2015 and 2016, some of the increase in the number of victims of sexual violations against children may be attributed to legislative changes (Bill C-26) to the maximum sentences for these offences which thereby affects the determination of the most serious violation in the incident. As a result, this also has an impact on the number of child and youth victims of sexual assault."
12,"Bill C-36 came into effect in December 2014. The new legislation targets ""the exploitation that is inherent in prostitution and the risks of violence posed to those who engage in it"" (Criminal Code Chapter 25, preamble). New violations classified as ""Commodification of sexual activity"" under ""violations against the person"" for which victims are identified include: the purchasing of sexual services or communicating for that purpose, receiving a material benefit deriving from the purchase of sexual services, procuring of persons for the purpose of prostitution, and advertising sexual services offered for sale."
13,"Victim age is calculated based on the end date of an incident, as reported by the police. Some victims experience violence over a period of time, sometimes years, all of which may be considered by the police to be part of one continuous incident."
14,"Lethbridge, Alberta and Belleville, Ontario became new census metropolitan areas (CMA) as of the 2016 Census."
15,"Data for Sherbrooke were not available in 2010, and therefore have been copied over from 2009 at the request of the police service."
16,"Part way through 2013, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police revised policing boundaries for rural detachments in New Brunswick. This resulted in a change in the census metropolitan area (CMA) boundaries that are determined for the purpose of reporting crime statistics. As such, 2013 data for the CMA of Moncton are not comparable to previous or future years. Further, data from 2014 onward are not comparable to years prior to 2014."
